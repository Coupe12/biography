    <h2>Summary of my life</h2>
    <p>
        I was born to the family of <strong>Mr Emmanuel and Josephine Ene</strong> in <em>Maiduguri, Borno State</em> in the year 2000, I was schooled and raised for the next few years of my life.<br>
        At the age of three, we moved to <em>Ibadan</em> where i attended Omolara Primary school till 2005, <em>Ibadan</em> was a wonderful city<br>
        I made so many good friends at that point in my life, I remember walking up and down different roads with my cousins
        drinking ice cream, not the ones you have this days but the one in sachets, It was in Ibadan they gave birth to my little
        like a dream then, my mom came back from a journey holding one small thing i learnt that small weird being that was sleeping
        I learnt from my mom then that she is my sister, <strong>Chizara</strong> I and my younger brother <strong>Ikechukwu</strong> looked on with amazement as if it was an
        alien we just could not take our eyes of this little being that joined the family. 

        From there we returned back to <em>Maiduguri</em> where we stayed till late 2008, at that point we travelled to <em>Abuja</em> where I have remained
        till today, I went from Eminence school, to African International College, to Kingsville College, to Apo boys where i graduated from secondary school in 2015 and wrote
        my jamb. I was not able to get admission immediately and had to wait till the next year to be enrolled, although not my first choice I found myself in a certain private
        school Caritas University from which I obtained my BSC degree.
